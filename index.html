                <p><strong>Time duration: </strong> 6:00 PM – 6:20 PM<br>
                    <strong>Played by: </strong> Disqualified teams<br>
                    Every team will be given some initial virtual money. And each player will be given a fixed share
                    price of worth<strong> 5.3 Lacs</strong>.<br>
                    The motive of this round is to create a priority list of the players. This should depend on your
                    analysis of which players might get sold above the share price to gain profit. The players will be
                    divided into 3 categories and you must choose:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 players from category 1</li>
                    <li>3 players from category 2</li>
                    <li>2 players from category 3</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The team with the highest net worth at the end of the auction will be the winner of this round.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Distribution of shares: </strong><br>
                    Disqualified teams will have to submit 7 players in a priority order (1 being the highest priority
                    and 7 being the lowest). During the Auction Round, the shares will be sold using the following
                    rules: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If only a single team is willing to buy an asset, then 100% shares of that player will be sold
                        to them at its share price.</li>
                    <li>If multiple teams are willing to buy an asset, then only the team which has given higher
                        priority to the asset in their priority list will be sold 100% shares of the asset.</li>
                    <li>If multiple teams are willing to buy an asset and have it at the same priority rank,
                        equal shares of the asset will be sold to them at its share price.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="italic-text">(The above rules are similar to that of the IPO round of Stonks, KPL) <br>

                    <code>Note: </code> A team buying a player in the auction and a team owning its 100% share should
                    not be confused.
                    Only the sale price matters as both rounds are running independently.

                    Analyse the players and prioritise the order wisely to gain maximum profit!

                <li>Keeping the unstable internet connections in mind, a player will only be sold once all other team

                </li>
                <li>The normalized scores of every player has been calculated beforehand using stats of previous 3 year
                    performances(2019, 2018, 2017) and some other important factors (whether a player is a captain,
                    their utility, everything has been taken care of). The normalised scores won’t be shared(ofc).
                </li>
                <li>In case a team buys 8 players, only the best 7 players will be considered. If a team is unable to
                    buy 7 players, it will automatically lose the auction.</li>
